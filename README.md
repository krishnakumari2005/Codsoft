Happy to share that I’ve begun my Python Programming Internship with CODSOFT.

As part of this internship, I’ll be developing practical mini-projects such as a To-Do List, Calculator, and Contact Book.

This experience is all about strengthening my core Python concepts, improving logical thinking, and gaining hands-on exposure to real-world problem solving through projects.

Looking forward to consistent learning and building better with time.
